      <h1>About Me</h1>

      <p>
        I’m Gian, a 21-year-old IT student from Cordova, Cebu. I originally started
        on a different path, but my interest in technology and software led me to
        pursue a career in IT.
      </p>

      <p>
        I may not be the smartest, but I focus on learning step by step and improving
        myself every day. I enjoy solving problems, experimenting with code, and
        creating small projects to apply what I learn.
      </p>

      <p>
        Aside from IT, I love dancing, drawing, and singing. These hobbies help me
        stay creative, patient, and balanced, which I also apply to my studies
        and projects.
      </p>

      <p>
        My goal is to become a skilled software developer who can build practical,
        efficient, and visually appealing applications. I am excited about learning
        more, taking on challenges, and growing both personally and professionally.
